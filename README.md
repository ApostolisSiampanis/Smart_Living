# Smart Living App

## Project Overview

The Smart_Living repository containts an Android application developed to manage and monitor smart devices within a connected living environment. Built using Kotlin and following the Clean Architecture approach, the application leverages Jetpack Compose for a modern, intuitive user interface. It integrates with Firebase for real-time data synchronization, backend management and user authentication.

The application aims to enhance energy efficiency, simplify device management and improve user comfort. Key features include location-based detection, which ensures the user is in their designated space and environmental monitoring through the use of temperature and humidity sensors. This holistic approach allows users to stay connected with their samrt devices and environment from anywhere.

## Key Features

- **Device Management:** Users can control and monitor connected smart devices, such as thermostats, air conditions and dehumidifiers directly from the app.
- **Energy Monitoring:** The app tracks energy consumption over time and provides insights into overall energy usage, helping users to optimize and reduce power consumption.
- **Location Detection:** The app uses Location Permission to detect if the user is within their own space.
- **User Authentication & Personalization:** Secure login and registration through Firebase Authentication, allowing users to manage their smart home devices and receive tailored experiences.
